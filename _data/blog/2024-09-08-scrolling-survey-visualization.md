**Project Goal**\
This project was a collaboration with the marketing team at my current company, a supply chain startup. It was meant to bring public attention to the company by analyzing overall industry trends in a visually compelling way.

**My Role**\
I was in charge of engineering for the entire experience and data preparation except the GDPR popup and CI/CD pipeline. 

**Design:**\
For the design, I collaborated with an incredibly talented illustration-focused graphic designer. I was in charge of motion, animation, and data visualization.

**Data and Engineering:**\
Data was pulled from a survey my company conducted of global leaders in the supply chain industry. I built the front end with Gatsby/React, D3 and [Scrollorama](https://johnpolacek.github.io/scrollorama/) 

This project is a few years old, but one of my few publicly available professional projects.
