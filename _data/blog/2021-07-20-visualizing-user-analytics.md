In my current role at the WSJ, my primary project is a large internal effort to analyze and visualize billions of readers' daily actions. A summary of this project was recently [published in Medium](https://medium.com/the-wall-street-journal/the-story-behind-wsjs-new-data-pipeline-for-audience-analytics-c6aa32dabd3e).

I act as the lead product designer and visualization engineer. This involves engineering and designing experiences that allow both technical and non-technical journalists to understand how their readers behave.

Unfortunately, I can't share visuals of the actual product because of an NDA.
