\
This project was a collaboration with the marketing team at my current company, a supply chain startup. It was meant to bring public attention to the company by analyzing overall industry trends in a visually compelling way.\
\
I was responsible for the engineering and data preparation for the entire experience, collaborating with the team on specific components like the GDPR popup and CI/CD pipeline.\
\
For the design, I worked with a highly skilled illustration-focused graphic designer. I took the lead on motion, animation, and data visualization, ensuring a seamless integration of her illustrations into the overall experience.

**Data and Engineering:**\
Data was pulled from a survey my company conducted of global leaders in the supply chain industry. I built the front end with Gatsby/React, D3 and Scrollorama. 

This project is a few years old, but one of my few publicly available professional projects.
