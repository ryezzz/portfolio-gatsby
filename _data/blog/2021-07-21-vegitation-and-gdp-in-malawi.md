In my master's I used satellite analysis to examine the economic impact of agricultural subsidies in sub-Saharan Africa. During creation of this microsite, I was in communication with the UN with the goal of creating a tool useful for policy makers.

I approached this project from a couple of different technical angles. First, as you can see in the above image, I wrote a python script from scratch to process and analyze Landsat satellite imagery. Take a look at some of my manual processing code [on GitHub](https://github.com/ryezzz/Sub-Saharan-Africa-NDVI-Analysis/tree/master/data_processing_python). Additionally I used d3.js and JavaScript within Google Earth Engine to study changes over time as can be seen [here](https://ryezzz.github.io/100_days_data_visualization/day_20/index.html) and in the below video\
