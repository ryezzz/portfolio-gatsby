This was my major "full stack" application while working in corporate finance. I designed and developed the entire beta version of the application and eventually, after more collaboration and evaluation, released it to hundreds of investors.

It's a tool that allowed professional investors to search for non-financial and web-scraped data, and relied heavily on Google Data Catalog, Flask, React and D3.

See my former manager presenting an early version of it [here](https://youtu.be/eUKqXZDXj78?t=1161) at Google Next.
