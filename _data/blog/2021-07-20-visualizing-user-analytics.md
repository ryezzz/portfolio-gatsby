During my time at the WSJ, my primary project was a large internal effort to analyze and visualize billions of readers' daily actions. A summary of this project was [published in Medium](https://medium.com/the-wall-street-journal/the-story-behind-wsjs-new-data-pipeline-for-audience-analytics-c6aa32dabd3e).

I  was the lead visualization engineer and product designer. This involved engineering and designing experiences that allowed both technical and non-technical journalists to understand how their readers behaved.

Technologies included: Javascript, Next.js, various JS based visualization libraries, and Tableau. Visuals are protected under an NDA.
