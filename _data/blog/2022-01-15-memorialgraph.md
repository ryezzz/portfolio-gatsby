This is a concept I've recently started to design and engineer as a way of holding on to individual history. It's inspired by the massive collective memory loss we've experienced due to COVID fatalities.

I'm working to create an easy to use editable timeline which allows individuals to record personal histories and either view electronically or print out large for memorial services. The idea is that these would be very broad highlights from life, giving a holistic understanding of personal history vs. detail.
