This web scraping project was made as part of Parsons School of Design’s Data Structures class.

I started with a [series difficult to read websites](http://a%20href%3D/), [and then parsed their data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryezzz/data-structures/master/aaMeetings/finalparse.js).

I then Loaded them to and [queried from a MongoDB database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryezzz/data-structures/master/aaMeetings/generatingmapfiles/app.js), and [mapped them using the Google Geolocation API.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryezzz/data-structures/master/aaMeetings/generatingmapfiles/app.js)

The final product was hosted on an AWS Server.
