I've kept a personal journal since middle school and the text in it is very much "stream of consciousness" and really, really tough to read. For instance:\

I recently realized, "Hey! I know how to do some basic NLP and I can shrink this down to something digestible!"

There's a few challenges I ran into here. First, I had to take a massive text document (like 300,000 words) with various date/entry formats and turn it into data I could analyze.

I chose a cobo of manual and automated processing to turn my journal into a CSV (code here)

Then, because I actually want to publish this, I removed the actual text and am now only publishing my aggrigations/simplification vs. raw entries. See code here.

Next, I visualized my first iteration based on entry word count in tableau here.

I really want to go deep into this analysis - it's so much fun! I've started writing my journal as a google form so it automatically generates a google sheet which can be connected live to my eventual app.
