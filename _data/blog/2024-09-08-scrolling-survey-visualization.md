I collaborated with the marketing team at my current company, a supply chain startup, for this scrolling analysis of the state of the supply chain industry. 

I was in charge of engineering for the entire experience and data preparation except the GDPR popup and CI/CD pipeline. 

For the design, I collaborated with an incredibly talented illustration-focus graphic designer. I was in charge of motion, animation, and data visualization.

Data pulled from survey my company conducted of global leaders in the supply chain industry.

This project is a few years old, but one of my few publically available professional projects.

Waffle charts are excellent for survey data!
