This was my major "full stack" application while working in corporate finance. I designed, developed, marketed  the entire beta version of the application and eventually, after more collaboration and evaluation, released it to hundreds of investors. 

It's a tool that allowed professional investors to search for non-financial and web-scraped data, and relied heavily on google data catalog, flask, and react.

See my former manager presenting an early version of it here.
