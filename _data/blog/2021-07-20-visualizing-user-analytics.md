In my current role at a major media company, my primary project is a large internal effort to analyze and visualize billions of reader's daily actions. A summary of this project was [published in Medium](https://medium.com/the-wall-street-journal/the-story-behind-wsjs-new-data-pipeline-for-audience-analytics-c6aa32dabd3e).

I act as the lead project designer and visualization engineer. This involves building and designing experiences that allow both technical and non-technical writers to understand how their readers behave.
