# Randomly generated color portfolio
This portfolio is built with GatsbyJS and Netlify CMS.

It's a heavily customized version of the  [starter](https://delog-w3layouts.netlify.com/) from [W3Layouts](https://w3layouts.com)

The basis of this portfolio is randomness and dynamism: It randomly generates colors vs. uses a static color pallet, additionally the background canvas voronoi graphic changes randomly on every reload.

As an artist and designer I have trouble deciding on styles for presenting my own work, and I find the only thing that doesn't bore me over time is constantly changing styles.
