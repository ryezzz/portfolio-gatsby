I created these designs using d3.js as part of a collaboration between Parsons School of Design and the UNDP Regional Bureau for Africa. They focus on income quintile trends in Sub-Saharan Africa found in the[World Development Indicators](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=world-development-indicators)data.

In the opening segment, income quintiles are illustrated by a single positive/negative bar chart sorted by amount of change. The user can hover over the chart to expand and read details on mouseover and click to compare an individual country

The second section visualizes income quintile distribution in Burkina Faso Ghana and Tanzania. These three countries were chosen to represent three different types of inequality trends on the African continent: Ghana shows rising inequality, Burkina Faso falling, and Tanzania an inverted u-shaped ∩ inequality trend
