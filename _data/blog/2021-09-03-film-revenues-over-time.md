[Here's a bar chart replacement/beeswarm plot concept](https://ryezzz.github.io/temp/) I created using d3's cluster force. It's based on Mike Bostock's [beeswarm](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6526445e2b44303eebf21da3b6627320) plot. This is an analysis of top grossing films over time, but can be applied to many other situations.


I created it using \[this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data)
