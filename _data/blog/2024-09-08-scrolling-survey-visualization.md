I was in charge of engineering for the entire experience and data preparation except the GDPR popup and CI/CD pipeline. 

For the design, I collaborated with an incredibly talented illustration-focused graphic designer. I was in charge of motion, animation, and data visualization.

Data was pulled from a survey my company conducted of global leaders in the supply chain industry.

This project is a few years old, but one of my few publicly available professional projects.
